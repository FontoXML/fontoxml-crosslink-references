For more information, see the {@link operation/open-document-preview-modal} operation.

## Usage of the CrossReferencePopover

The {@link CrossReferencePopover} operation is used to show more information about a crosslink.

This popover can be used by configuring it for the desired element. See the {@link Creating a popover} guide for more information.
